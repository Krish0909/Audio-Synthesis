# Accent Conversion Using Deep Learning

This repository contains the implementation of an **Accent Conversion** system, which transforms speech from one accent to another while preserving the speaker's identity. The project utilizes advanced deep learning techniques to achieve high-quality and natural-sounding accent conversion.

## Overview

Accent conversion is a challenging task in the field of speech synthesis. This project aims to:
- Convert speech from one accent to another while retaining the speaker's unique voice characteristics.
- Provide tools and models for high-quality accent conversion.

## Features

- **Speaker preservation:** Maintains the speaker's original voice.
- **Multiple accents:** Supports conversion between multiple accents.
- **Modular design:** Easy to extend and customize for new datasets or architectures.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/accent-conversion.git
   cd accent-conversion
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. (Optional) Set up GPU acceleration for faster training and inference.

## Usage

1. Preprocess your dataset:
   ```bash
   python preprocess.py --data_dir <path_to_dataset>
   ```

2. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python train.py --config config.yaml
   ```

3. Perform inference:
   ```bash
   python infer.py --input <input_audio_path> --output <output_audio_path>
   ```

4. Evaluate the model's performance:
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py --results_dir <path_to_results>
   ```

## Dataset


## Model Architecture

The core model is based on a neural network architecture with the following components:
- **Encoder-Decoder:** Captures the content of speech while normalizing accent.
- **Style Transfer Module:** Transfers accent features from target to source.
- **Adversarial Loss:** Ensures the converted speech matches the target accent.
